* Allow redirect URIs that start with "http://". however we still will not traverse those pages but we will get the authorization code from the URL. (#720)

* Fixed a bug that caused ADAL to erroneously unpercent encode query parameters being passed on. (#689)


Version 2.2.0 (05.16.2016)
-------------
